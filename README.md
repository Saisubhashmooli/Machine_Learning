# Machine_Learning
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that uses statistical learning algorithms to build systems that have the ability to automatically learn and improve from experiences without being explicitly programmed.

ML algorithms can be broadly classified into three categories Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement learning.

## Supervised Learning:
In supervised learning we have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and we use an algorithm to learn the mapping from input to output. In other words, a supervised learning algorithm takes a known set of input dataset and its known responses to the data (output) to learn the regression/classification model. A learning algorithm then trains a model to generate a prediction for the response to new data or the test datasets.

Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems when data mining: classification and regression:

### Classification:
Classification problems use an algorithm to accurately assign test data into specific categories, such as separating apples from oranges. Or, in the real world, supervised learning algorithms can be used to classify spam in a separate folder from your inbox. Linear classifiers, support vector machines, decision trees and random forest are all common types of classification algorithms.

### Regression:
Regression is another type of supervised learning method that uses an algorithm to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Regression models are helpful for predicting numerical values based on different data points, such as sales revenue projections for a given business. Some popular regression algorithms are linear regression, logistic regression and polynomial regression.

## Un-Supervised Learning:
Unsupervised Learning is used when we do not have labelled data. Its main focus is to learn more about the data by inferring patterns in the dataset without reference to the known outputs. It is called unsupervised because the algorithms are left on their own to group the unsorted information by finding similarities, differences and patterns in the data. Unsupervised learning is mostly performed as a part of exploratory data analysis. It is most commonly used to find clusters of data and for dimensionality reduction.

Unsupervised learning models are used for three main tasks: clustering, association and dimensionality reduction:

### Clustering:
Clustering is a data mining technique for grouping unlabeled data based on their similarities or differences. For example, K-means clustering algorithms assign similar data points into groups, where the K value represents the size of the grouping and granularity. This technique is helpful for market segmentation, image compression, etc.

### Association:
Association is another type of unsupervised learning method that uses different rules to find relationships between variables in a given dataset. These methods are frequently used for market basket analysis and recommendation engines, along the lines of “Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought” recommendations.

### Dimensionality reduction:
Dimensionality reduction is a learning technique used when the number of features  (or dimensions) in a given dataset is too high. It reduces the number of data inputs to a manageable size while also preserving the data integrity. Often, this technique is used in the preprocessing data stage, such as when autoencoders remove noise from visual data to improve picture quality.

## Reinforcement Learning
In simple terms, reinforcement learning can be explained as learning by continuously interacting with the environment. It is a type of machine learning algorithm in which an agent learns from an interactive environment in a trial and error way by continuously using feedback from its previous actions and experiences. The reinforcement learning uses rewards and punishments, the agents receive rewards for performing correct actions and penalties for doing it incorrectly.
